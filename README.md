# XCTestExtensions

Swift testing utilties, extending the capabilities of XCTest.

Includes helpers for:

- quickly loading test data from the bundle
- running an external executable and checking its output
- better comparison of strings
- performing asynchronous actions in tests, and waiting for them to complete
